Python Debugging:
cd into the "backend" folder 
Run the command "venv\Scripts\activate" to activate the virtual environment
If Pythons interpretar path is not set to the virtual environment follow these steps:
    - Ctrl+Shift+P to the Command Pallete
    - Search for "Python: Select Interpretar"
    - Enter Interpreter Path
    - Enter the path "<YOUR_PATH>/backend/venv/Scripts/python.exe
Now the debugger will work
To deactivate run "deactivate"
